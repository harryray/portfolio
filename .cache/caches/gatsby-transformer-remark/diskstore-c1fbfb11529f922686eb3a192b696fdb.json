I guess maybe I'm a <em>lot</em> of a junk-food junkie, actually. Despite being cursed with lactose intolerance and having my enjoyment of cheese cut down in its prime, I still find it very hard to resist cramming far too much lactose-filled food into my mouth - but always find time to regret it over the subsequent 14 hours.</p>\n<p>It was during one of those deep, deep food comas that I realised there are more than a few similarities between Web Development, and food -- specifically, pizza. In this post, we'll cover what they are, and on the way, we'll go over 3 super-important things to get right, at the start of your career in Web Development.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8S1ViSn.gif\" alt=\"Pizza Time!\"></p>\n<h2>Step 1: The Base</h2>\n<p>Whether you're going deep-pan, thin-crust or just a regular dough - the base is crucial. You wouldn't build a house without the foundation; you wouldn't make a pizza without the base; you wouldn't develop a website without the basics.</p>\n<p><strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> - That's your foundation. <strong>HTML</strong> to give you the structural markup, forming the skeleton of your website. It's what you see on screen. <strong>CSS</strong> is like taking that dough, and drizzling just the tiniest bit of olive oil along the crust before you stick it in the oven, and then flouring it <em>juuust</em> right when your pizza comes out. Beautiful. </p>\n<p><strong>CSS</strong> takes your structural <strong>HTML</strong>, and beautifies it. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/HCx3syuZkqLsI/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47f718a8491cb95aa139f5e73c9aaa3e90a56b94ac&#x26;rid=giphy.gif\" alt=\"Ringo Pizza\"></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Say Cheese - We're Getting Saucy</h2>\n<p>Two pizza puns in one title - are you kidding me?! Audacious. Anyway - <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which is what breathes life into your website, is the next step above CSS. It's the best way to handle animations, and it takes your website from essentially a PDF to something more. It provides interaction on the front end for your users. Get your dough skeleton, and slather it with oodles of that gooey, stringy, thick <strong>JavaScript</strong> cheese. I'm so hungry. Obviously, the sauce goes down first, this is only a metaphor. Direct cheese-to-base contact outside of the sanctity of the crust is a sin; we all know that.</p>\n<p>This step is also the section where your users will get interaction on the back end -- careful now -- with <strong>PHP</strong>. If you're using a <strong>Content Management System</strong>, it's likely that <strong>PHP</strong> will be running it behind the scenes. Most of the internet runs on <strong>WordPress</strong>, which is a <strong>PHP</strong> platform. Through your <strong>CMS</strong> - or even without one - <strong>PHP</strong> will control things like your forms, meaning your users will be able to communicate back up the chain to you. </p>\n<p>It'll also help your site connect with your database, teaming up with <strong>MySQL</strong> to be the perfect pair of sous-chefs - carrying your content and data back and forth between your website and your database, like they're fetching ingredients for your pizza. </p>\n<p>Do you need a sous-chef to make a pizza?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/IgpFpAndwRpNDd8tt6/giphy.gif\" alt=\"This is a visual metaphor for your database, and content.\"></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Top it off!</h2>\n<p>I debated about the placement of a few of these toppings, as I felt like they were <em>more</em> essential - but really, everything in this post is key to making you a well-rounded web developer; so it's all exactly where it needs to be. Who eats just <em>Cheese n' Tomato</em> pizza, after all? Live on the edge. Have a Pepperoni Passion.</p>\n<p>Anyway -- sidetracked by the Domino's menu, again -- this section covers toppings. A healthy mix of them is important, which is the Papa Johns' <em>The Works</em> pizza is an all-time great.</p>\n<p>You'll need to develop a decent understanding of <strong>Search Engine Optimisation</strong>. <strong>SEO</strong> is largely the realm of content, but there is a <em>lot</em> you can do as a Web Developer, and it's best if you do it from the ground up when coding a site. As the developer of a website, you should try to ensure that best practices are followed -- that means Alt tags on images, correct markup for headings (following the  of <strong>h1</strong> > <strong>h6</strong>), canonicals and other meta info for each page -- that kind of thing. If you're cooking up a perfect little pizza disc and somebody else is making the toppings for you, you'd want to make sure those toppings were good, right?</p>\n<p>You should also consider <strong>what</strong> you're developing. If somebody orders a pizza, but they want you to put the mushrooms <em>underneath</em> the sauce, you should probably recommend that that would be a pretty bad <strong>User Experience</strong>. If you get a design for a site that you think might not be accessible enough, or might be confusing for new users, or might just not work as expected on mobile -- you need to mention it. There's no use in developing something with bad <strong>UX</strong>, and that's something that from a developer point of view you should consider.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the individual toppings on a pizza <em>aren't</em> as fundamental as the base, or that deep red tangy tomato sauce, or the piping hot, stringy, creamy, milky-white mozzarrella -- but the presence of the toppings at all <em>is</em>. If you're going to order a pizza, you're going to order <em>The Works</em> - not a <em>Cheese n' Tomato</em>. Be a <em>The Works</em> developer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/rD5Z2jab2CcKs/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e474ae421000e53b2a10d1fdd0bb00697035e42cfcc&#x26;rid=giphy.gif\" alt=\"Guy Fieri Pizza\"></p>\n<h2>Step 4: This isn't really a step - it's the future.</h2>\n<p>You're a master pizza professional. You know the feel of hot dough in your hands, the crunch of a crisped crust as you pull apart the slices, the squish of inches-deep cheese and sauce under-tooth. You know it. You're a Web Developer now.</p>\n<p>But what if you don't want just, a pizza? What if you want a calzone? Pizza rolls?</p>\n<p>This is where your niche and your specialisations come in. Want to specialise in Web Apps? Go for <strong>React</strong>, and frameworks that help control <strong>UI</strong>. How about <strong>.NET</strong>? Back-end Developer? Front-end Developer? Designer/Developer? Maybe you want to specalise in a specific <strong>CMS</strong> - say, <strong>Magento</strong>. It's up to you. </p>\n<p>But remember, it's all really just pizza, all the way down.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media1.giphy.com/media/WQOIIBIildFsp7bJUP/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47e0136bdb06dec74ec14a0db2e0a2e0c290bfcd93&#x26;rid=giphy.gif\" alt=\"Thank you for reading!\"></p>"}
