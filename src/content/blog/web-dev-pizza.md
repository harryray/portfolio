I'm a bit of a junk-food junkie. I guess maybe I'm a _lot_ of a junk-food junkie, actually. Despite being cursed with lactose intolerance and having my enjoyment of cheese cut down in its prime, I still find it very hard to resist cramming far too much lactose-filled food into my mouth - but always find time to regret it over the subsequent 14 hours.

It was during one of those deep, deep food comas that I realised there are more than a few similarities between Web Development, and food -- specifically, pizza. In this post, we'll cover what they are, and on the way, we'll go over 3 super-important things to get right, at the start of your career in Web Development.

##Step 1: The Base

Whether you're going deep-pan, thin-crust or just a regular dough - the base is crucial. You wouldn't build a house without the foundation; you wouldn't make a pizza without the base; you wouldn't develop a website without the basics.

**HTML** and **CSS** - That's your foundation. **HTML** to give you the structural markup, forming the skeleton of your website. It's what you see on screen. **CSS** is like taking that dough, and drizzling just the tiniest bit of olive oil along the crust before you stick it in the oven, and then flouring it *juuust* right when your pizza comes out. Beautiful. 

**CSS** takes your structural **HTML**, and beautifies it.

##Step 2: Say Cheese - We're Getting Saucy

Two pizza puns in one title - are you kidding me?! Audacious. Anyway - **JavaScript**, which is what breathes life into your website, is the next step above CSS. It's the best way to handle animations, and it takes your website from essentially a PDF to something more. It provides interaction on the front end for your users. Get your dough skeleton, and slather it with oodles of that gooey, stringy, thick **JavaScript** cheese. I'm so hungry. Obviously, the sauce goes down first, this is only a metaphor. Direct cheese-to-base contact outside of the sanctity of the crust is a sin; we all know that.

This step is also the section where your users will get interaction on the back end -- careful now -- with **PHP**. If you're using a **Content Management System**, it's likely that **PHP** will be running it behind the scenes. Most of the internet runs on **WordPress**, which is a **PHP** platform. Through your **CMS** - or even without one - **PHP** will control things like your forms, meaning your users will be able to communicate back up the chain to you. 

It'll also help your site connect with your database, teaming up with **MySQL** to be the perfect pair of sous-chefs - carrying your content and data back and forth between your website and your database, like they're fetching ingredients for your pizza. 

Do you need a sous-chef to make a pizza?

##Step 3: Top it off!

I debated about the placement of a few of these toppings, as I felt like they were *more* essential - but really, everything in this post is key to making you a well-rounded web developer; so it's all exactly where it needs to be. Who eats just *Cheese n' Tomato* pizza, after all? Live on the edge. Have a Pepperoni Passion.

Anyway -- sidetracked by the Domino's menu, again -- this section covers toppings. A healthy mix of them is important, which is the Papa Johns' *The Works* pizza is an all-time great.

You'll need to develop a decent understanding of **Search Engine Optimisation**. **SEO** is largely the realm of content, but there is a *lot* you can do as a Web Developer, and it's best if you do it from the ground up when coding a site. As the developer of a website, you should try to ensure that best practices are followed -- that means Alt tags on images, correct markup for headings (following the  of **h1** > **h6**), canonicals and other meta info for each page -- that kind of thing. If you're cooking up a perfect little pizza disc and somebody else is making the toppings for you, you'd want to make sure those toppings were good, right?

You should also consider **what** you're developing. If somebody orders a pizza, but they want you to put the mushrooms *underneath* the sauce, you should probably recommend that that would be a pretty bad **User Experience**. If you get a design for a site that you think might not be accessible enough, or might be confusing for new users, or might just not work as expected on mobile -- you need to mention it. There's no use in developing something with bad **UX**, and that's something that from a developer point of view you should consider.

Ultimately, the individual toppings on a pizza *aren't* as fundamental as the base, or that deep red tangy tomato sauce, or the piping hot, stringy, creamy, milky-white mozzarrella -- but the presence of the toppings at all *is*. If you're going to order a pizza, you're going to order *The Works* - not a *Cheese n' Tomato*. Be a *The Works* developer.

##Step 4: This isn't really a step - it's the future.


You're a master pizza professional. You know the feel of hot dough in your hands, the crunch of a crisped crust as you pull apart the slices, the squish of inches-deep cheese and sauce under-tooth. You know it. You're a Web Developer now.

But what if you don't want just, a pizza? What if you want a calzone? Pizza rolls?

This is where your niche and your specialisations come in. Want to specialise in Web Apps? Go for **React**, and frameworks that help control **UI**. How about **.NET**? Back-end Developer? Front-end Developer? Designer/Developer? Maybe you want to specalise in a specific **CMS** - say, **Magento**. It's up to you. 

But remember, it's all really just pizza, all the way down.
